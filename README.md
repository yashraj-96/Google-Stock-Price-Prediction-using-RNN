# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-RNN
A dataset comprising of Google Stock Prices from 2012 to 2017 was used for forecasting the stock prices for month of January 2017. A special data structure with 60 time steps was built for RNN network to process. A robust RNN Network comprising of 4 LSTM layers along with Dropout was built which resulted in accurate predicted trends and least RMSE value.
